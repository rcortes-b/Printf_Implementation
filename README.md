## 📍 Overview 📍

This project is about creating a function that replicates the behaviour of the printf function in C.  


---

## 📍 Rules 📍

The functions have to follow a strict rule. For example, you cannot intitialize a variable in the line where you declare it.


---


## 🔎 _What is implemented?_

This function supports the following conversions: *cspiduxX%*

%c: Print a single character.

%s: Print a null-terminated string.

%d or %i: Print a signed integer.

%X or %x: Print an unsigned integer in hexadecimal format.

%p: Print the address of a pointer in hexadecimal format.

%u: Print an unsigned integer in decimal format.

%%: Print a percent sign '%'.

## 🚀 Getting Started  🚀 

### 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the Printf repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rcortes-b/Printf_Implementation.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:
```sh
cd Printf_Implementation
```

3. Compile the dependencies:
```sh
make
```

### 🤖 Use ft_printf
Once the library is successfully compiled, you can use it in your projects. Link the `libftprintf.a` file to your program.
To compile your program with Printf, use:
```sh
gcc -o my_file.c libftprintf.a && ./a.out
```
